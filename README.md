# Asset Zip Management with PhysFS Personal Research

## About me

I am [Enric Pérez Rifà](https://github.com/PerezEnric), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in
Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/). This content is generated for the second year’s
subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).

## About the project

This project is about loading assets from a compressed archive (in this case we will work with Zip file). To reach this goal the library PhysFS and SDL functions will be used.
